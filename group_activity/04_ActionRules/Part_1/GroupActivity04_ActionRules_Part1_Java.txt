Cloud Computing for Data Analysis

Group Activity 04 - PART1: Download Action Rules software in Java and run in Eclipse or NetBeans

Download the project file from: http://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS6190/Exercises/ActionRulesExample.zip

Use the data that comes with the .zip file. Input files: 'attributes.txt' and 'data.txt' is present in both projects.

1. The .zip file is a Java project. You can import it directly in Eclipse
2. The .zip file comes with two projects: ActionRules and LERS 
3. Right click on ActionRules -> Build Path. Check if the LERS project is added to the project Action Rules
4. Attribute and Data file names can be changed in StrigsDAO.java file in the LERS project. By default it is set to the given file names: 'attributes.txt' and 'data.txt' 
5. We can change file path of attributes in line - 4 in StringsDAO.java
6. We can change file path of data in line - 5 in StringsDAO.java
7. Run the java code
8. The code asks following choices:
	1. Enter Stable Attributes
	2. Go Next
9. If we choose option 1,
	- the code gives all available attributes
	- and asks to enter an attribute from those attributes for the stable attribute
	- enter an attribute and click Enter
10. If we choose option 2,
	- the code gives all available attributes
	- and asks to enter an attribute from those attributes for the decision attribute
	- Once you choose the decision attribute, the code asks you for decision from and decision to values from the chosen decision attribute
	- give all attribute values and click Enter
11. Now the code asks you minimum support and minimum confidence. (Give minimum support of atleast 1 and minimum confidence of atleast 10)
12. The code now executes for some time and generates action rules.
13. Copy the result to a .txt file and upload in Canvas
