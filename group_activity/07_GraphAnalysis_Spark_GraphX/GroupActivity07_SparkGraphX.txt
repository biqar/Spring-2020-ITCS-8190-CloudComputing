Group Activity 07 - Spark GraphX
---------------------------------

Creating Scala-Spark project and adding dependencies in Scala-IDE

	1.1. Open Scala-IDE
	1.2. Create New Maven project
	1.3. Right click on the project, click Configure and click "add Scala Nature" 
	1.4. Add the following dependencies in pom.xml.
		<dependencies>
  			<dependency>
  				<groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
  				<artifactId>spark-core_2.11</artifactId>
  				<version>2.1.2</version>
  			</dependency>
  			<dependency>
  				<groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
  				<artifactId>spark-graphx_2.11</artifactId>
  				<version>2.1.2</version>
  			</dependency>
  		</dependencies>
	1.5. Right click on the project and click "Properties"


Part-1:
1. Download GraphXBasics.scala from http://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS6190/Exercises/SparkGraphX/GraphXBasics.scala
	Copy this file into your project
	//This code executes a simple GraphX operations

2. Click RunAs and select Maven Clean  

3. Click RunAs and select Maven Install. This creates a .jar file inside 'target' folder in your project

4. Run this .jar file in the cluster or in Eclipse

NOTE: We have to give an output path as an argument value
NOTE: We need to specify your hadoop home directory in the program, if you are running the code in Eclipse

5. To run in a cluster, use: spark2-submit --master yarn --class "ClassName" INPUT_PATH_TO_JAR_FILE OUTPUT_PATH

6. We will get Multiple Output files. Upload all output files in Canvas.


Part-2
1. Create a new Maven project and do necessary configurations as told before

2. Download GraphXShortestPath.scala from http://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS6190/Exercises/SparkGraphX/GraphXShortestPath.scala
	Copy this file into your project.
	//This code executes Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm for a given dataset

2. Download 'animal_terms.txt' from http://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS6190/Exercises/SparkGraphX/animal_terms.txt
	//This file contain graph vertices(animal names)

3. Download 'animal_distances.txt' from http://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS6190/Exercises/SparkGraphX/animal_distances.txt
	//This file contain graph edges in the format of: (animalVertex1,animalVertex2,edge_weight) 

NOTE: We need to specify your hadoop home directory in the program, if you are running the code in Eclipse
NOTE: We should specify 3 argument values: 1: file path of animal_terms.txt , 2: file path of animal_distances.txt , 3: output path

4. Get a .jar file as mentioned in Part-1

5. To run the jar file in cluster, use:  
	spark2-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client --driver-memory 16G --executor-memory 16G --class "ClassName" INPUT_PATH_TO_JAR_FILE INPUT_PATH_TO_VERTICES_FILE INPUT_PATH_TO_EDGES_FILE OUTPUT_PATH

6. Submit the output file in Canvas
